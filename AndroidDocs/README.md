Repository containing contents related to android

The reason behind creating this repo is because [android developer page](https:://developers.android.com) gives us all a nightmare when we want to implement something new in android. 

Here I have tried to document the workaround or possible solutions to the common android problems that:
1. took significant efforts in implementing
2. are frequent enough
