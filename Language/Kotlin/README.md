# Kotlin
Kotlin is the statically typed, multiplatform programming language that support type inference.

Lets understand each of these terms above:
* **Statically typed**: It means that in koltin the type of the variable is determined at compile only.
* **Multi-Plaform**: It means that kotlin can be used to write computer softwares that can run on multiple plafroms.
* **Type Inference**: It means that type of the variable can be automatically determined by the kotlin compiler.

## Data Types
Before understanding data types we will first try to understand what are **literals**. 

**Literals:** In kotlin or any other programming language we operate on numbers, character and strings. These are called **literals** the very basic entity of a language. Any thing that we do involve these **literals**.\
So, there are 3 types of literals:
* Numbers: These are used for repesent quantity. Eg: 1, 1_2_3, 10000, 10_000, 10___000
* Character: A single digit, word or special character. They are enclosed inside single quotes. Eg: 'a', '#', '1', '1a'(invalid character because it has 2 entities a number and a word).
* String: Group of one or more character enclosed inside double quotes. Eg: "A", "A a", "A_#"

Data type for Numbers:

| Data type | Size(bits) | Min. Value | Max. Value |
| --- | ----------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Byte | 8 | -2<sup>7</sup> | 2<sup>7</sup> - 1 |
| Short | 16 | -2<sup>15</sup> | 2<sup>15</sup> - 1 |
| Int | 32 | -2<sup>31</sup> | 2<sup>31</sup> - 1 |
| Long | 64 | -2<sup>63</sup> | 2<sup>63</sup> - 1 |
